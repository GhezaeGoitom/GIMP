

GIMP is an IMP like simple imperative programming language that has been built
for the final exam of a course named “Formal Methods In Computer Science”.




Primary data Types:

The primary data types we are going to use in GIMP are Integer and Boolean.
 Integer (Int) : all integer values from negative to positive including zero
 Boolean (Bool) : all boolean values which are true and false
When the variables are declared, the user can choose to immediately assign them a
value, or to assign a value later on.


Data Structures:

The data Structure we are going to use in GIMP is array
 Array : holds elements of primary data type, for now it’s implemented to
hold only Int values.
Control Structure:
Here are the fundamental Control Structure in GIMP
 If (Control) Structure
 IF ELSE: The else statement is optional and will execute only if the
condition in the if statement evaluates to false.
 While (Reputation) Structure
 WHILE DO: execute a block of statements continuously until the given
condition evaluates to false
 Assignment and Declaration Operators
 Assignment: Assigning values into given variable
 Declearation: declarations specify the data type of the variable we’re
declaring
 Skip: a skip performs a jump, and does nothing

Operators :

Helps us to to perform operation on variables, in GIMP we implemented operators
based on the type expressions. We can see detailed information in grammer.




How to run GIMP:

All the directive to run the GIMP interpreter are present in Main.hs, running using
“runghc” will let you run the file.

1. Navigate to the project directory
2. Run main.hs using this command “runghc Main.hs”
3. You will be presented with two options “Run program” and “Exit”
4. After typing “1” for “Run program”
5. Type your test code in single line
6. Hit enter and you will get the result
